Simple collaborative app to keep track of D4 servers status

The star symbol means that you have reviewed the server.  
The cross symbol means that the last rate is older than 3 days, so its better recheck the server.  
In brackets the review counter.  

bad => unplayable: server lags everywhere even in town  
laggy => lags but still playable  
good => the server sometimes lags but you can definitely play on it  
excellent => no lag
